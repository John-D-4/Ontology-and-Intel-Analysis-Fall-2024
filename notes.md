the tome of twenty "moreover"s, I dislike the confident teleological distinctions of intel between mil, pol, ns. they are valid of course, but seem to be a distraction, not substantially valuable so far. while the information in and the desired outcome vary, the process (cycle and tasks therein) are fundamentally the same. ELINT works no differently for a criminal than a soldier or terrorist.
