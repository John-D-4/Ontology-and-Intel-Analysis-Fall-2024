the tome of twenty "moreover"s, I dislike the confident teleological distinctions of intel between mil, pol, ns. they are valid of course, but seem to be a distraction, not substantially valuable so far. while the information in and the desired outcome vary, the process (cycle and tasks therein) are fundamentally the same. ELINT works no differently for a criminal than a soldier or terrorist.

discussing epistemic communities, field theory, and knowledge circulation citing east german intel archives. field theory didn't stick with me in "Empirical analysis: using FIELD THEORY to understand quotidian interactions between theEast German HVA, the Syrian political police and the Russian KGB" - maybe i need to study the theory more to bring out the 'coopetition' concept and implications' import
